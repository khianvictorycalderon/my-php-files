### These are my PHP Files
Each file code demonstrates individual different capabilities.

They say PHP is a dead language, or rarely used nowadays, but not for me, i like PHP.

## **Note**:
I used WAMP server to run PHP codes, before you run PHP codes, do the following:
- Install WAMP Server
- Create your .php file
- Put your code there
- Run WAMP Server
- Go to `localhost`
- Open the php file with localhost, example: `localhost:index.php` or `localhost:projects/test.php` or something like that.
